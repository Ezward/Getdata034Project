The project produces 2 files, SubjectActivityFeature.txt and SubjectActivityFeatureMean.txt.  They share the column structure described below.  SubjectActivityFeature.txt contains the original feature readings.  SubjectActivityFeatureMean.txt is a summary of that original data where each feature's readings are grouped by subject and activity and the mean is calculated.
